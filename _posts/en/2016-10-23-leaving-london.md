It’s a typical day in September. The sky is grey and a cold wind is blows. However, in here it’s warm and it smells like fried bacon and freshly brewed coffee. We’re sitting at the View Tube our favourite breakfast cafe and are having our last breakfast in London. Eggs benedict and a flat white for me and a porridge and an americano for Ina. It’s not very busy as it’s Wednesday. Only a mother with her newborn child sits in an armchair and enjoys a coffee. Next to us a young man talks to a woman and occasionally plays with the guitar on his lap. This is our last day in London and we are a bit sad but mostly excited about what lies ahead of us.

For two years we’ve lived here. However, the original plan was to move to France. Initially we thought Paris, Bordeaux or Montpeiller. But when I coincidentally saw a job offer from a company in Corsica we started picturing how great life would be on an island in the mediterranean sea. Consequently, we were very excited when I got the job and decided to take this step. The idea of living close to the sea in the warm mediterranean climate helped us to eliminate all our doubts and in September 2014 we travelled with all out stuff in a small trailer to the corsican capital Ajaccio. Corsica is indeed a gorgeous island that has a lot to offer. We surfed in the mediterranean sea, went hiking in the mountains and enjoyed the sun on beautiful white beaches. The landscapes are just breathtaking and our we were lucky to have nice flatmates that showed us around.

As you probably know we didn’t stay very long though. I didn’t like my new job at all and after a few weeks we hit the road again. After a minor detour and stops in Marseille and Bordeaux we arrived in London in November. Within a few weeks, we found a nice and small flat in East London and met some friendly people that eventually became great friends.
We’ve thoroughly enjoyed our time here and we’ve experienced and learned a lot. We’ll miss the walks in the Olympic Park on our doorstep or along the canals as much as we’re gonna miss the pub nights with friends.
However, now this chapter has ended too as we’ve decided to go on a long journey through Southeast Asia. Therefore, we’ve quit our jobs and cancelled the contract for our apartment. In early November after a few weeks in Germany we’ll fly to Hanoi. But more about our travel plans and why we chose Southeast Asia in our next post.
